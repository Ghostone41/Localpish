- **Automatic Tool Installation:** Downloads required external tools (Ngrok)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Internet connection for dependency installation
- Windows OS (some modifications required for other OS)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/localsix/Localpish.git
cd Localpish
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
```
python localphish.py
```

2. Follow the interactive prompts:
   - Set your target URL (where victims will be redirected after login)
   - Choose whether to automatically fetch the login template from the target site
   - Select a tunneling method (Ngrok recommended for public access)

3. Once the server is running, you'll get a URL to share with your targets. All captured credentials will be saved to `save.txt` in the script directory.

## Tunneling Options

### NGROK
- Requires free registration at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)
- Provides a public URL accessible from anywhere
- You will need to provide your Ngrok authtoken when prompted

### LOCALHOST ONLY
- For testing purposes only
- Only accessible on your local machine

## Technical Details

### Directory Structure
- `.tmp/` - Temporary directory for website templates
- `save.txt` - File where captured credentials are saved

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ngrok not working**
   - Ensure your authtoken is correct
   - Check if port 4040 is accessible
   - Verify your firewall isn't blocking Ngrok

2. **Template fetching fails**
   - Try providing a manual HTML template
   - Check your internet connection
   - Some sites may have anti-bot protections

3. **Permission errors**
   - Run the script with appropriate permissions
   - Ensure the directory is writable
